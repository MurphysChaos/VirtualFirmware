Virtual Firmware API for Pre-Silicon Driver Development
Published under the GNU Public License v2.

About the Project 
================= 

Virtual Firmware (hereafter referred to as "the Project") is a project, in
cooperation with Intel Corporation, under the Software Engineering Capstone
program at Portland State University.  Its purpose is to build a set of
tools for simulating a hardware environment to allow driver developers to
test their drivers without "working silicon."

The particular project with Intel involves communicating between a driver
and a firmware.


Components of the Project
=========================

We are working with QEMU-KVM to create two running virtual machines. On the
first virtual machine (VM) is an emulator running the ThreadX RTOS with a
proprietary firmware created by Intel (this component is not available on
the public domain).  The second VM is running Fedora 14 Linux with a
modified Intel e1000 driver and virtual hardware component.

Between the two VMs is a sockets library, allowing for metacommunication
between the driver and firmware, outside the normal communications chain for
QEMU networking.


Requirements
============
This API was developed using Express Logic ThreadX RTOS. The following files 
protected under a proprietary license and must be supplied by the developer:

tx.lib
tx_api.h
tx_port.h

The library should be put in the project's root folder and the headers 
should be put in the vf_tx folder.


About the Software Engineering Capstone
=======================================

Portland State University (PSU) operates non-traditional requirements for
the general education requirements of an accredited university. Part of that
requirement is a "Senior Capstone" where the members of a team work with the
community on a significant project. Numerous capstones, representing varied
disciplines, exist, one of which is a Software Engineering capstone.

The Software Engineering capstone takes the form of building a software
product with a team for sponsors in the local area. The overall project is
meant to approximate the working conditions of working for a "customer,"
gathering requirements, building a specification, research, design, coding,
distribution, etc.
